# Support for you!
Have you ever felt like **you are too stupid**? Do you always feel like that? Probably yes, in that case you came to a **right place**. Quizizz Support lets you get even better score on your school quizzes, **without much effort**.

# How to install
Go to **[releases page](https://github.com/AndyFilter/QuizizzSupport/releases/latest)**. Read the **guide there**, or:

 - For the _**ReleaseX.X.rar**_ - **Unzip**, Run the _*QuizizzSupport.exe*_,  if this doesn't work try downloading the *QuizizzSupport.exe* file and running it.
  
 - For the _**QuizizzSupport.exe**_ - Run the _*QuizizzSupport.exe*_.

The difference between *ReleaseX.X.rar* and *QuizizzSupport.exe* is that to run the program you need **.NET 3.2**, the first (*ReleaseX.X.rar*) does not have that included (**you might** still **have it installed on your computer**), *QuizizzSupport.exe* (~150mb file) on the other hand has **everything included**. If you don't care, just download the *QuizizzSupport.exe*. It should work.
# How to use

 - All you need to do is open the quiz, copy the link or ID (ex. *https://quizizz.com/join/quiz/69b0842093a8c21371cb2115/start*, *123456*, *https://quizizz.com/join?gc=123456*). And paste it into the ***Quiz ID or Quizizz Url*** box

# Edits & Forks
Feel free to fork the project and tweak, fix, add to the code. I tried to add as many **useful comments** to the code as it's possible, so code should be **easy to read** even tho it was **written in just a few hours**.
I'll be fixing and adding to the code my self, when I'll see a need to.
