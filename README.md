# Support for you!
Have you ever felt like **you are too stupid**? Do you always feel like that? Probably yes, in that case you came to a **right place**. Quizizz Support lets you get even better score on your school quizzes, **without much effort**.

# How to install
Go to **[releases page](https://github.com/AndyFilter/QuizizzSupport/releases/latest)**. Read the **guide there**, or:

 - For the _**QuizizzSupport.exe**_ - Run the _*QuizizzSupport.exe*_,  if this doesn't work try downloading the *QuizizzSupportFramework.exe* file and running it.
  
 - For the _**QuizizzSupportFramework.exe**_ - Run the _*QuizizzSupportFramework.exe*_.

The difference between *QuizizzSupportFramework.exe* and *QuizizzSupport.exe* is that to run the program you need **.NET 3.2**, the second (*QuizizzSupport.exe*) does not have that included (**you might** still **have it installed on your computer**, you probably do), *QuizizzSupportFramework.exe* (~150mb file) on the other hand has **everything included**. If you don't care, just download the *QuizizzSupportFramework.exe*. It should work.
# How to use

 - All you need to do is open the quiz, copy the link or **Code** (ex. *https://quizizz.com/join/quiz/69b0842093a8c21371cb2115/start*, *123456*, *https://quizizz.com/join?gc=123456*)

# Questions and Issues
If you have any kind of question or issue to report. Join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/68ttDh42Ee) and ask anything.

# Edits & Forks
Feel free to fork the project and tweak, fix, add to the code. I tried to add as many **useful comments** to the code as it's possible, so code should be **not that hard to read** even though it was **written in a hurry**.
I do not plan of further updates, but who knows, just **don't expect any updates from me**.
