# Edits & Forks
Feel free to fork the project and tweak, fix, add to the code. I tried to add as many **useful comments** to the code as it's possible, so code should be **easy to read** even tho it was **written in just a few hours**.
I'll be fixing and adding to the code my self, when I'll see a need to.
